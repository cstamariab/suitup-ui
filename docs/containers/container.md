# Container

The Container Component is a very basic component that wrap your components to provide a max width depending on the screen width.

Containers are not needed for Box to make it work, like in other frameworks. It's there just in case you need it.

Container will be also useful if you want to add a 'margin' to your components.

```jsx
<Container>
    <YourComponent/>
</Container>
```
